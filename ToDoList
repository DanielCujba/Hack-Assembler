*Nand2Tetris - Chapter 4 Project*

Main Goal:
Build a fully fuctional Assembler that takes the Assembly writen code and transforms it into machine code for the Hack Computer

To Do:

1.Build the Parser Module - Complete - no comments added
Description: Will break each assembly command into is components to be later process by the other modules.

2.Build the Code Module - Incomplete
Description: Will take the data from the parser module and translate it into machine code.

3.Build the Symbol Table Module - Complete - no comments added
Description: Will take data from the parser module and transform symbols into acutal addresses which will be store into a python dictionary.

4.Connect the 3 modules together - Incomplete
Description: The workflow of the Assembler Program will involve importing the assembly text from a ".asm" file. Afterward, the parser module will break the code into smaller chunks. This chunks will be than fed to the symbol table module which will build a dictionary for the user generated symbol. The dictionary will be initialize with a series of predefined symbols. Lastly, the code module translates each chunk fed from the parser module into machine code. In case of symbol, the code module will use the symbol table to translate it. The translated program will than be store in a ".hack" file.
